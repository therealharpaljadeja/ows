# Local Wallet Standard (LWS)

A specification and reference implementation for secure, local-first crypto wallet management — designed for AI agents.

## Motivation

AI agents increasingly need to interact with blockchains: signing transactions, managing accounts, and moving value across chains. Existing wallet infrastructure was built for humans clicking buttons in browser extensions, not for programmatic agents operating autonomously.

LWS addresses this gap. It defines a minimal, chain-agnostic standard for wallet operations where:

- **Private keys never leave the local machine.** Keys are stored in encrypted Ethereum Keystore v3 format with strict filesystem permissions — no remote servers, no browser extensions.
- **Agents interact through structured protocols.** The primary interface is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server, giving AI agents native wallet access without custom integrations.
- **Transaction policies are enforced before signing.** A pre-signing policy engine gates every operation, so agents can be granted scoped, auditable access to wallet capabilities.
- **One interface covers all chains.** CAIP-2/CAIP-10 addressing and a unified signing interface abstract away chain-specific details across EVM, Solana, Bitcoin, Cosmos, and Tron.

## Getting Started

Read the spec starting with [`docs/01-storage-format.md`](docs/01-storage-format.md), or browse it at [localwalletstandard.org](https://localwalletstandard.org).

Install the reference implementation:

```bash
curl -sSf https://openwallet.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cd lws
cargo build --workspace --release
cargo test --workspace
```

## CLI

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lws generate` | Generate a new BIP-39 mnemonic phrase |
| `lws derive` | Derive an address from a mnemonic (via env or stdin) |
| `lws sign-message` | Sign a message using a vault wallet with chain-specific formatting |
| `lws sign-transaction` | Sign a raw transaction using a vault wallet |
| `lws create-wallet` | Create a new wallet (generates mnemonic, encrypts, saves to vault) |
| `lws list-wallets` | List all saved wallets in the vault |
| `lws info` | Show vault path and supported chains |
| `lws update` | Update lws to the latest version |
| `lws uninstall` | Remove lws from the system |

## SDKs

LWS provides client SDKs that wrap the REST API (`http://127.0.0.1:8402`) with full type safety.

### Python

```bash
pip install lws
```

```python
from lws import LWSClient, ChainType

async with LWSClient(api_key="lws_key_...") as client:
    wallets = await client.list_wallets()
    result = await client.sign_and_send(
        wallet_id=wallets[0].id,
        chain_id="eip155:8453",
        transaction={"to": "0x...", "value": "1000000000000000"},
    )
    print(result.tx_hash)
```

A synchronous client is also available:

```python
from lws import LWSClientSync

with LWSClientSync(api_key="lws_key_...") as client:
    wallets = client.list_wallets()
```

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install @lws/sdk
```

```typescript
import { LWSClient } from "@lws/sdk";

const client = new LWSClient({ apiKey: "lws_key_..." });

const wallets = await client.listWallets();
const result = await client.signAndSend({
  wallet_id: wallets[0].id,
  chain: "eip155:8453",
  transaction: { to: "0x...", value: "1000000000000000" },
});

console.log(result.tx_hash);
```

Both SDKs require Node 18+ (TypeScript) or Python 3.10+ (Python). See the full API in `sdks/python/` and `sdks/typescript/`.

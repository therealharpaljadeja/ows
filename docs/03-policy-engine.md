# Policy Engine

> How transaction policies are defined, evaluated, and enforced before any key material is touched.

## Access Model

```
sign_transaction(wallet, chain, tx, credential)
                                       │
                          ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                          │                          │
                     passphrase                 ows_key_...
                          │                          │
                     owner mode                 agent mode
                     no policy                  policies enforced
                     scrypt decrypt             HKDF decrypt
```

| Caller | Authentication | Policy Evaluation |
|---|---|---|
| **Owner** | Passphrase | **None.** Full access to all wallets. |
| **Agent** | `ows_key_...` token | **All policies attached to the API key** are evaluated. Every policy must allow (AND semantics). |

The credential itself determines the access tier. No bypass flags. The owner uses the passphrase; agents use tokens. Different agents get different tokens with different policies.

If the owner wants policy-constrained access for themselves, they create an API key and use the token instead of the passphrase.

## API Key Cryptography

### Token-as-capability

When the owner creates an API key, OWS decrypts the wallet secret using the owner's passphrase and **re-encrypts it under a key derived from the API token**. The encrypted copy is stored in the API key file. The agent presents the token with each signing request; the token serves as both authentication and decryption capability.

### Key derivation (HKDF-SHA256)

API tokens are 256-bit random values (`ows_key_<64 hex chars>`). HKDF-SHA256 is used to derive the encryption key:

```
token = ows_key_<random 256 bits, hex-encoded>
salt  = random 32 bytes (stored in CryptoEnvelope)
prk   = HKDF-Extract(salt, token)
key   = HKDF-Expand(prk, "ows-api-key-v1", 32)  →  AES-256-GCM key
```

The `CryptoEnvelope` struct is reused with a new KDF identifier:

```json
{
  "cipher": "aes-256-gcm",
  "cipherparams": { "iv": "..." },
  "ciphertext": "...",
  "auth_tag": "...",
  "kdf": "hkdf-sha256",
  "kdfparams": { "dklen": 32, "salt": "...", "info": "ows-api-key-v1" }
}
```

### Key creation flow

```bash
ows key create --name "claude-agent" --wallet agent-treasury --policy spending-limit
```

1. Owner enters wallet passphrase
2. OWS decrypts the wallet secret using scrypt(passphrase)
3. Generates random token: `T = "ows_key_" + hex(random 256 bits)`
4. Generates random salt S
5. Derives key: `K = HKDF-SHA256(S, T, "ows-api-key-v1", 32)`
6. Encrypts the wallet secret with K via AES-256-GCM
7. Stores key file with `token_hash: SHA256(T)`, policy IDs, and encrypted secret copy
8. Displays T once — owner provisions it to the agent
9. Zeroizes the decrypted secret from memory

### Agent signing flow

```
Agent calls: sign_transaction(wallet, chain, tx, "ows_key_a1b2c3...")

1. Detect ows_key_ prefix → agent mode
2. SHA256(token) → look up API key file
3. Check expires_at (if set)
4. Verify wallet is in key's wallet_ids scope
5. Load policies from key's policy_ids
6. Build `PolicyContext` (chain ID, wallet ID, API key ID, transaction context, spending context, timestamp)
7. Evaluate all policies (AND semantics, short-circuit on first deny)
8. If denied → return POLICY_DENIED error (key material never touched)
9. HKDF-SHA256(salt, token) → AES key → decrypt secret from key.wallet_secrets
10. Resolve the chain-specific signing key from that secret (HD derivation for mnemonic wallets, direct curve-key selection for private-key wallets)
11. Sign transaction
12. Zeroize decrypted secret and derived key
13. Return signature
```

### Revocation

Delete the API key file. The encrypted secret copy is gone. `SHA256(T)` matches nothing. The token is useless. The original wallet and other API keys are unaffected.

### Security properties

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Token stolen, no disk access | Useless — encrypted key file not accessible |
| Disk access, no token | Can't decrypt — HKDF + AES-256-GCM |
| Token + disk access | Can decrypt, but requires bypassing OWS process entirely |
| Owner passphrase changed | API keys unaffected (independently encrypted) |
| API key revoked | Encrypted copy deleted — token decrypts nothing |
| Multiple API keys | Independent encrypted copies; revoking one doesn't affect others |

## Declarative Policy Rules

These rule types are evaluated in-process (microseconds, no subprocess). Per-transaction value caps, recipient allowlists, and cumulative daily spend are **not** implemented as declarative rules; use an **`executable`** policy (see below) if you need that level of control.

### `allowed_chains`

Restricts which CAIP-2 chain IDs can be signed for.

```json
{ "type": "allowed_chains", "chain_ids": ["eip155:8453", "eip155:84532"] }
```

### `expires_at`

Time-bound access (compares `PolicyContext.timestamp` to this ISO-8601 string).

```json
{ "type": "expires_at", "timestamp": "2026-04-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

### `allowed_typed_data_contracts`

Restricts which smart contracts an API key can sign EIP-712 typed data for. The rule checks the `domain.verifyingContract` field of the typed data against an allowlist of addresses.

```json
{
  "type": "allowed_typed_data_contracts",
  "contracts": ["0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3"]
}
```

**Behavior:**
- For `sign_message` and `sign_transaction` calls, this rule **passes through** (does not restrict).
- For `sign_typed_data` calls where the domain includes a `verifyingContract`, the address must be in the `contracts` list (case-insensitive comparison).
- For `sign_typed_data` calls where the domain **omits** `verifyingContract`, the rule **denies** — the contract cannot be verified.

**Example policy:**
```json
{
  "id": "permit2-only",
  "name": "Restrict to Permit2 typed data",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-03-30T00:00:00Z",
  "rules": [
    { "type": "allowed_chains", "chain_ids": ["eip155:8453"] },
    { "type": "allowed_typed_data_contracts", "contracts": ["0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3"] }
  ],
  "action": "deny"
}
```

## Custom Executable Policies

For anything declarative rules can't express — on-chain simulation, external API calls, complex business logic. Custom executables are the escape hatch.

### Protocol

```
echo '<PolicyContext JSON>' | /path/to/policy-executable
```

- The executable receives the full `PolicyContext` as a single JSON object on stdin
- The executable MUST write a single `PolicyResult` JSON object to stdout
- A non-zero exit code is treated as a denial
- Stderr is captured by the evaluation path and may be surfaced in denial details

### Evaluation order within a policy

A policy can have both `rules` (declarative) and `executable` (custom). When both are present:

1. Declarative rules evaluate first (in-process, fast)
2. If declarative rules deny → skip executable (no subprocess spawned)
3. If declarative rules allow → spawn executable for final verdict
4. Both must allow

Declarative rules act as a fast pre-filter. The executable only runs for requests that pass basic checks.

## Policy File Format

Policies are JSON files stored in `~/.ows/policies/`:

```json
{
  "id": "base-agent-limits",
  "name": "Base Agent Safety Limits",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-03-22T10:00:00Z",
  "rules": [
    { "type": "allowed_chains", "chain_ids": ["eip155:8453", "eip155:84532"] },
    { "type": "expires_at", "timestamp": "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z" }
  ],
  "executable": null,
  "config": null,
  "action": "deny"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique policy identifier |
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable policy name |
| `version` | integer | yes | Policy schema version (currently `1`) |
| `created_at` | string | yes | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| `rules` | array | no | Declarative rules (see above). Evaluated in-process. |
| `executable` | string | no | Absolute path to a custom policy executable |
| `config` | object | no | Static configuration passed to the executable via `PolicyContext.policy_config` |
| `action` | string | yes | Currently `"deny"` only. Denied policies block the request. |

A policy MUST have at least one of `rules` or `executable`. If `executable` is set, it MUST point to an executable file when the policy is evaluated.

## PolicyContext

The base JSON object available to policy evaluation:

```json
{
  "chain_id": "eip155:8453",
  "wallet_id": "3198bc9c-6672-5ab3-d995-4942343ae5b6",
  "api_key_id": "7a2f1b3c-4d5e-6f7a-8b9c-0d1e2f3a4b5c",
  "transaction": {
    "to": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f2bD0C",
    "value": "100000000000000000",
    "raw_hex": "0x02f8...",
    "data": "0x"
  },
  "spending": {
    "daily_total": "50000000000000000",
    "date": "2026-03-22"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-03-22T10:35:22Z"
}
```

| Field | Type | Always Present | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chain_id` | string | yes | CAIP-2 chain identifier |
| `wallet_id` | string | yes | Wallet ID in scope for this request |
| `api_key_id` | string | yes | The ID of the API key making this request |
| `transaction` | object | yes | Transaction context. EVM includes parsed `to`, `value`, and `data` when available. All chains include `raw_hex`. |
| `spending` | object | yes | Lightweight spending metadata currently exposed by the engine |
| `timestamp` | string | yes | ISO 8601 timestamp of the signing request |

For executable policies, the engine injects `policy_config` into the JSON payload when the policy file includes a `config` object.

### `typed_data` (optional)

Present only for `sign_typed_data` calls. Omitted entirely for `sign_message` and `sign_transaction`.

```json
{
  "typed_data": {
    "verifying_contract": "0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3",
    "domain_chain_id": 8453,
    "primary_type": "PermitSingle",
    "domain_name": "Permit2",
    "domain_version": "1",
    "raw_json": "{...full EIP-712 JSON...}"
  }
}
```

All fields except `primary_type` and `raw_json` are optional (the EIP-712 domain can omit any field). Executable policies can use `raw_json` to inspect the full typed data structure including message fields.

## PolicyResult

```json
{ "allow": true }
```

```json
{ "allow": false, "reason": "Daily spending limit exceeded: 0.95 / 1.0 ETH" }
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `allow` | boolean | yes | `true` to permit the transaction, `false` to deny |
| `reason` | string | no | Human-readable explanation returned in the denial path |

## Timeout and Failure Semantics

For custom executable policies only (declarative rules cannot fail in these ways):

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Executable exits with code 0, valid JSON on stdout | Use the `PolicyResult` as the verdict |
| Executable exits with non-zero code | **Deny.** Treat as `{ "allow": false }`. |
| Executable does not produce valid JSON on stdout | **Deny.** |
| Executable does not exit within 5 seconds | **Deny.** Kill the process. |
| Executable not found or not executable | **Deny.** |
| Unknown declarative rule type | **Deny.** Fail closed on unrecognized rules. |

The default-deny stance ensures that policy failures are never silently bypassed.

## Policy Actions

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `deny` | Block the transaction and return a `POLICY_DENIED` error |

## Policy Attachment

Policies are attached to API keys, not wallets. When an API key is created, it is scoped to specific wallets and policies:

```bash
# Create a policy
ows policy create --file base-agent-limits.json

# Create an API key with wallet scope and policy attachment
ows key create --name "claude-agent" --wallet agent-treasury --policy base-agent-limits
# => ows_key_a1b2c3d4e5f6...  (shown once, store securely)
```

An API key can have multiple policies attached. All attached policies are evaluated — every policy must allow the transaction for it to proceed (AND semantics). Evaluation short-circuits on the first denial.

## Example: Custom Simulation Policy

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Simulate transaction via eth_call before allowing."""
import json, sys, urllib.request

ctx = json.load(sys.stdin)
tx = ctx["transaction"]
rpc = {"eip155:8453": "https://mainnet.base.org"}.get(ctx["chain_id"])
if not rpc:
    json.dump({"allow": False, "reason": f"No RPC for {ctx['chain_id']}"}, sys.stdout)
    sys.exit(0)

payload = json.dumps({
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "eth_call",
    "params": [{"to": tx["to"], "value": hex(int(tx["value"])), "data": tx["data"]}, "latest"]
}).encode()
try:
    resp = json.load(urllib.request.urlopen(
        urllib.request.Request(rpc, data=payload, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}), timeout=4))
    if "error" in resp:
        json.dump({"allow": False, "reason": f"Reverted: {resp['error']['message']}"}, sys.stdout)
    else:
        json.dump({"allow": True}, sys.stdout)
except Exception as e:
    json.dump({"allow": False, "reason": str(e)}, sys.stdout)
```

The corresponding policy file:

```json
{
  "id": "simulate-tx",
  "name": "EVM Transaction Simulation",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2026-03-22T10:00:00Z",
  "rules": [
    { "type": "allowed_chains", "chain_ids": ["eip155:8453"] }
  ],
  "executable": "/home/user/.ows/plugins/policies/simulate.py",
  "action": "deny"
}
```
